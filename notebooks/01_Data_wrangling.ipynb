    "\n",

    "\n",

    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **PK** | 2014 | Comedy |\n",

    "| **3 idiots** | 2009 | Comedy |\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the example, every value can be defined by its position based on its labels. For example, the value at `PK`/`Genre` is `Comedy`. In pandas, this would be `movies.loc['PK', 'Genre']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, every value cab be defined by its position. For example, in the second row, and first column, the value is `2001`. In pandas this would be `movies.iloc[1, 0]` (remember that in Python, the first index is `0`, the second is `1`...)\n",
    "\n",

    "To select a whole column from a `DataFrame` (which will be a `Series`) we can use `movies['rating']` (like getting a value from a `dict`). If the name of the column does not contain special characters, we can also use `movies.rating` (like for a class attribute or a `namedtuple`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can perform operations with the resulting `Series`:\n",

    "- To mark the beginning of the string use `^`, and `$` for the end.\n",
    "- A digit (0 to 9) is matched by `\\d`\n",
    "- To match specific characters a range can be defined, for example `[a-z]` would match all lower case letters. They can be combined, like in `[a-zA-Z]`.\n",
