    "\n",
    "More formally, a `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional structure, where each element is labelled both by its column and its row.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Movie | Year | Genre |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **PK** | 2014 | Comedy |\n",
    "| **Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...** | 2001 | Drama |\n",
    "| **3 idiots** | 2009 | Comedy |\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the example, every value can be defined by its position based on its labels. For example, the value at `PK`/`Genre` is `Comedy`. In pandas, this would be `movies.loc['PK', 'Genre']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, every value cab be defined by its position. For example, in the second row, and first column, the value is `2001`. In pandas this would be `movies.iloc[1, 0]` (remember that in Python, the first index is `0`, the second is `1`...)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Can you obtain the value in the column `storyline`, and the row `tt2905838` in the movies `DataFrame`. Can you guess which is the movie? :)"

    "To select a whole column from a `DataFrame` (which will be a `Series`), we can access is by `movies['rating']` (like for a `dict`), and if the name of the column does not contain special characters, also by `movies.rating` (like for a class attribute or a `namedtuple`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can perform operations with:\n",
    "- Compute the maximum, the minimum, the median, or any other provided statistic:\n",
    "   - `movies['rating'].min()`\n",
