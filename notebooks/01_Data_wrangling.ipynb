    "### Selecting data\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas has two main containers, `Series` and `DataFrame`. You can think as a `DataFrame` as the content of a spreadsheet, or a SQL table. And `Series` as one of its columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional structure, where each element is labelled both by its column and its row.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Movie | Year | Genre |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **PK** | 2014 | Comedy |\n",
    "| **Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...** | 2001 | Drama |\n",
    "| **3 idiots** | 2009 | Comedy |\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the example, every value can be defined by its position based on its labels. For example, the value at `PK`/`Genre` is `Comedy`. In pandas, this would be `movies.loc['PK', 'Genre']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, every value cab be defined by its position. For example, in the second row, and first column, the value is `2001`. In pandas this would be `movies.iloc[1, 0]` (remember that in Python, the first index is `0`, the second is `1`...)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Can you obtain the value in the column `storyline`, and the row `tt2905838` in the movies `DataFrame`. Can you guess which is the movie? :)"

    "To select a whole column from a `DataFrame` (which will be a `Series`) we can use `movies['rating']` (like getting a value from a `dict`). If the name of the column does not contain special characters, we can also use `movies.rating` (like for a class attribute or a `namedtuple`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can perform operations with the resulting `Series`:\n",
    "- Compute the maximum, the minimum, the median, or any other provided statistic:\n",

This is how it was presented in the original source.\n",

    "But this format is not appropiate to do operations. For example, if we want to check the smallest (`.min()`) or the largest (`.max()`) number of votes in our data, we're not getting the right results. This is because when dealing with strings, `'9'` is greater than `'10'` in the same was `z` is \"greater\" than `ab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "1. Create a new column `rating_votes` with the number of votes converted as a number. The first step is to get a string representation that does not contain the commas. This can be done with the method `.str.replace()`, replacing the commas with empty strings. Second is to convert the column type, from a Python object to a float representation. This can be done with the method `.astype()`.\n",

    "1. Get the smallest and largest values for the number of votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check how many missing values we have in the data (pandas provides the methods `.isnull()` and `.notnull()`). Remember that in Python, `True == 1` and `False == 0`, so you can sum `True` and `False` values.\n",
    "\n",
